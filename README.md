### Hi there! You found me! 👋

I am Uy - it is pronounced `/wiː/` or yes-in-french - and am a computer science master student!
This year is my final year and I am looking for a job.

#### What are my principles? ⚖️

* Keep it clean! I try to code as clean as possible. It was an eye-opening experience when I read Clean Code by Uncle Bob. 
* Be honest with what you are capable of! It is never wrong to admit you can't something. Then you have opportunity to grow.

#### What skills do I have? 💪

During my years of studying computer science I have reached a broad scope of
theoretical knowledge about software engineering.
During the summers I have had two interships that gave me real experience in the field.

Some of the soft skills I would say I have learned over time is:
* cooperation in teams
* independence
* honesty

Some of the technology I know:
* Python
* Java
* Spring Boot
* React
* JavaScript
* Nextjs
* Django
* MySQL
* Heroku
* ElasticSearch

#### What am I currently learning? 🤖

I would like to improve my overall software skills to be a competent fullstack developer.
I am open to everything, but currently I use some of my spare time
to sharpen my frontend skills with Next.js and server-side rendering.

#### What would I like to work with? 💼

I am very interested in building systems that will impact people's everyday.
This is why I for instance have volunteered to work with Gryttr, a webapp for discovering climbing outside.
(I love to climb/boulder by the way).

I am also interested in the consulting business and would like to work as a consultant one day!

#### What do I do now? 🎥

Currently, I am working with my thesis. Hit me if you are interested in [A Tool for In-Video Feedback](https://lci.idi.ntnu.no/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MasterThesis_InVideoFeedback.pdf).
